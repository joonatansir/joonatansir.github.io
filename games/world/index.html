        <h2>Untitled world building god game (aka UWBGG)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This is a game about building a world piece by piece. You start with a single block and expand the world by choosing where and what to build next. The world's population of little dudes will increase as you place more blocks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently this demo is very free-form without much explicit goals. Some future ideas:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Resources? Each block would produce resources that you would use to expand the world. The amount of resources a block produces would depend on what types of blocks surround it.</li>
          <li>Merge mechanics? Maybe your three farms combine into a super farm to give a boost to the population of a village nearby. Maybe your villages combine into castles and castles into citadels and citadels into etc etc. </li>
          <li>Multiplayer? Maybe you can build a world peacefully together or choose to destroy your enemies by building an army and strategically placing defenses.</li>
          <li>All of the above?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Click a block to build next to it. Arrow keys cycles through the different block types. Hold right mouse button to rotate the view. Scroll wheel to zoom.
